# Hotel Data Analysis with Pandas (Star Schema Approach)

## Overview

This project aims to analyze hotel bookings data using Python's Pandas library, focusing on data cleaning, transformation, and insights generation. The dataset is organized and analyzed following a star schema methodology, enabling multidimensional analysis of hotel bookings.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with code for data cleaning, transformation, and insights.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data processing and visualization.
- **Documentation**: Additional resources related to the analysis.
- **Results**: Outputs, visualizations, and summaries of insights obtained.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have:

- Python 
- Pandas library
- Jupyter Notebooks (optional but recommended)


## Dataset

The dataset used is a hotel bookings dataset comprising various details such as booking information, customer data, room types, and reservation status. It's stored in the 'Data' directory and preprocessed for analysis.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, data type corrections, and ensuring dataset consistency.
2. **Data Transformation**: Structuring the data into a star schema (fact and dimension tables) for multidimensional analysis.
3. **Data Insights**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive insights into booking trends, popular room types, peak booking periods, customer demographics, etc.
